# Clustering Algorithms in R

This repository contains new asymmetric dissimilarity measures based on generalized Manhattan dissimilarity for fuzzy and non-fuzzy clustering in R, including:

- **Non-Fuzzy Clustering**: Methods such as k-means and K-quantile clustering.
- **Fuzzy Clustering**: Algorithms like Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and Fuzzy C-quantile clustering.
