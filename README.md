# Clustering Algorithms in R

This repository contains new asymmetric dissimilarity measures based on generalized Manhattan dissimilarity for fuzzy and non-fuzzy clustering in R, including:

- **Non-Fuzzy Clustering**: K-means, k-medians, and K-quantile clustering methods.
- **Fuzzy Clustering**: Fuzzy C-means (FCM), Fuzzy C-medians, and Fuzzy C-quantile clustering methods.
